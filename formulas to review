Geometry:
 - Descartes Triangles
 -Incenter: triangle with a,b,c and points x,y, the location of orthocenter is ax + bx +cx / a+b+c and ay + by + cy / a+b+C
 -Circumcenter: Call circumcenter of triangle (x,y). then ,the circumcenter's distance to all vertex must be the same. Solve the system of equations to obtain x,y
 
 
 Roots/ polynomials
      -Newtons Sums
      
 Complex Numbers:
      -Roots of Unity: 
             - if z^n = a, then z^n = a(1). root of 1 is e^k(i) pi  for k = 0,1,2....n;
             - To find z just root the sides by n. Find points
      - De Movire's theorem

General stuff:
     -x^a = (x-1)(x^a-1 ...... + 1)
Coordinate geometry:
      - Shifting left and right does not affect area, so you can shift to make it easier
Fractions
      - If something is complex on the denominator but that variable is also expressed in the numerator, make it so that the denominator is expressed with one variable s
      -Try to eliminate fractions, by multiplying all by denominators
     
Centroid point:
 - (x,y) = ((x1  +x2  +x3)/3,  (y1 + y2 + y3)/3)
 - Centroid is 2/3 way from vertex to midpoint

Rewriting Variables:
   - When there is a lot of variables, it is usually good to write one variable in terms of another ,even if you dont know how much they differ. i.e r = k+x, for making r similar to k
